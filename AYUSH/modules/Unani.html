        <h1>UNANI</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Unani medicine, also called Unani tibb, Arabian medicine, or Islamic medicine, a traditional system of
                healing and health maintenance observed in South Asia. The origins of Unani medicine are found in the
                doctrines of the ancient Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen. As a field, it was later developed and
                refined through systematic experiment by the Arabs, most prominently by Muslim scholar-physician
                Avicenna. During the Caliphate (the political-religious Muslim state that began in 632 CE), the bulk of
                Greek knowledge was translated into Arabic, part of that knowledge being the principles of medicine.
                With additional contributions of medical wisdom from other parts of the Middle East and South Asia,
                Unani medicine came to be known also as Arabian, or Islamic, medicine.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Modes of treatment</h2>
            The initial approach to treatment in the Unani system entails the establishment of a regimen to normalize
            and balance the external factors (e.g., air, water, and food) involved in ailments and diseases. If this
            proves inadequate, then other means, such as treatment with natural medicines, may be recommended. Any Unani
            treatment prescribed by a hakim acts as an outside agent to help boost the patient’s tabiyat and thus
            restore good health and a sense of well-being.

            There are various therapeutic approaches available to the hakim. Ilaj-bi-ghiza, or dietotherapy, involves
            recommending a specific diet, which is the simplest and most natural course of treatment by a hakim. For
            fever, for example, Unani medicine stresses a nutrient-rich, low-roughage diet that might include dalia
            (porridge) and kheer (a milk broth). Both the amount and quality of food are taken into consideration.
            Relatively infrequent in modern Unani therapy is ilaj-bi-misla, or organotherapy, a mode of treatment that
            involves healing a diseased organ with the use of tissue extracts from the same organ of a healthy animal.
            Ilaj-bi-dawa, or pharmacotherapy, is the use of medicines by Unani hakims. This treatment method is
            considered by hakims to be natural, eco-friendly, and less intrusive and more effective than many other
            methods. The Unani system’s pharmacopoeia is vast, enriched with more than 2,000 medicines derived from
            various herbal, mineral, and animal sources.</p>

            <p>Unani medications are often processed by classical methods of preparation as originally described in
                Greco-Arabic medicine. Unani medicines are used singly or are compounded with other substances to
                achieve synergistic, antagonistic, or detoxifying effects or simply as bases for effective ingestion and
                assimilation.

                In the 1920s Indian physician Ajmal Khan revolutionized Unani medicine by advocating that research be
                conducted on various natural products that were claimed by ancient physicians to effect miraculous
                cures. In the 1930s Indian-born scientist Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, who specialized in phytochemistry (the
                chemistry of plants), isolated potent constituents from a plant known in India as chhota chand
                (Rauwolfia serpentina). Subsequent pharmacological research determined that the plant was the source of
                a bioactive substance known as reserpine, which found use in Western medicine as a tranquilizer and as
                an antihypertensive agent (lowering abnormally high blood pressure). Those uses supported some of the
                medical applications that had been described by hakims. Siddiqui named the derived medicines, which
                included ajmaline and ajmalicine, for Khan as a tribute to his groundbreaking research efforts.

                Having gained recognition from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1976, the Unani system became
                increasingly accepted internationally as a system of traditional medicine. In India several institutions
                engaged in Unani teaching and research. The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), an
                undertaking of the Indian government, for instance, facilitated the translation of classical heritage,
                the organization of clinical trials, the improvement of drug standardization, and the investigation of
                toxicological and phytopharmacological properties of natural products that had long been used by hakims.
            </p>

            <p>Classical Unani medicine recommended established “regimental” therapies (tadabeer) in the treatment of
                various chronic and acute diseases. Those therapies include dalak (massage), hammam (bath and sauna),
                karat (exercise), fasd (venesection, or opening a vein to let out blood), hijamat (cupping, a process of
                drawing blood to the surface of the body by using a glass cup or tube), and amat-e-kai (leeching, or
                bleeding a person by using leeches). The essential function of all those regimens is to remove impure
                blood or impurities from the body.

                Surgical interventions, or ilaj-bil-yad, are a last resort. Their practice generally is beyond the realm
                of the hakim’s expertise.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Principles of Unani medicine</h2>
            The history of Unani medicine can be characterized by the work of its practitioners, or hakims, who relied
            on natural healing based on principles of harmony and balance, uniting the physical, mental, and spiritual
            realms.</p>
            <p>
            <h2>Al-Umoor al-tabiyah: basic physiological principles</h2>
            According to practitioners of Unani medicine, the health of the human body is maintained by the harmonious
            arrangement of al-umoor al-tabiyah, the seven basic physiological principles of the Unani doctrine. These
            principles include (1) arkan, or elements, (2) mizaj, or temperament, (3) akhlat, or bodily humours, (4)
            aaza, or organs and systems, (5) arwah, or vital spirit, (6) quwa, or faculties or powers, and (7) afaal, or
            functions. Interacting with each other, these seven natural components maintain the balance in the natural
            constitution of the human body. Each individual’s constitution has a self-regulating capacity or power,
            called tabiyat (or mudabbira-e-badan; vis medicatrix naturae in Latin), or to keep the seven components in
            equilibrium.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Arkan and mizaj: elements and temperament</h2>
            As four simple, indivisible entities—arz (earth), maa (water), nar (fire), and hawa (air)—arkan not only
            constitutes the primary components of the human body but also makes up all other creations in the universe.
            There are predictable consequences to the actions and interactions (imtizaj) of the four arkan. As these
            elements act upon and react with each other, they continually undergo change into various states of “genesis
            and lysis” (generation and deterioration), due to ulfat-e-keemiyah (acceptance of a medicine by the body)
            and nafarat-e-keemiyah (rejection of a medicine). Skilled hakims claim that they can perceive, recognize,
            and observe such states.

            The four essential mizaj (temperaments) are hot, cold, moist, and dry. Four more are compounded of those
            single temperaments—namely, hot and dry, hot and moist, cold and dry, and cold and moist. Possessed in
            different proportion, mizaj is balanced by all entities in the cosmos, including all plants, minerals, and
            animals. The equilibrium of the individual’s elemental combination and resulting mizaj, as determined by
            tabiyat, provides a stable constitution to that individual—in other words, health. Just as elemental balance
            keeps an individual in a healthy state, changes in natural temperament cause the health of an individual to
            suffer. Therefore, mizaj plays a pivotal role in Unani in characterizing a person’s normal state (physical,
            mental, and social), as well as the nature of a disease.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Doctrine of akhlat</h2>
            Hippocrates propounded the doctrine of fluids, or humours, of the body, and he categorized the humours into
            four groups based on their colour. These groups were refined by Galen and later by Avicenna. They appear in
            Unani practice as dam (blood), balgham (phlegm), safra (yellow bile), and sauda (black bile). The human
            dispositions corresponding to these humours are, respectively, sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and
            melancholic. Each person is considered to have a specific humoral makeup, determined by the predominance of
            a given humour in his or her constitution. The quality and quantity of the humours in an individual—a
            person’s unique, proper, and proportionate humoral makeup—is said to guarantee health. Conditions other than
            this balance signal ailment or disease.</p>
