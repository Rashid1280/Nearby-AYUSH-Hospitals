            <h2>What Is Yoga?</h2>
            The literal translation of the word “yoga,” which is from Sanskrit (recognized as the original language of
            yoga) is “union,” says Sherwin.right up arrow And that’s an apt way to describe yoga as we know it today,
            she says. “We define it as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the breath.”
            Many people have come to know the physical benefits of yoga and think of it as a type of workout, says
            Sherwin. But yoga is way more than that. “It’s really an entire lifestyle; the postures are only one piece
            of it,” she says.</p>

            <p> Yoga began in India and has been around for about 5,000 years, says Sherwin. “Originally it was taught
                one-on-one and only to men of the highest caste,” she says.

                Traditionally, yoga is a system to foster well-being on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual
                levels.right up arrow Yoga is now not generally thought of as a set of religious beliefs. It can be
                practiced in a completely secular manner, and it's practiced by people of all faith traditions, as well
                as people who are agnostic and atheist, according to the Yoga Alliance.right up arrow
                Yoga is thought to have first come to the United States at the end of the 19th century and beginning of
                the 20th. One critical moment was when Swami Vivekananda spoke at the World Parliament of Religions in
                Chicago in 1893. </p>
            <p>
                Another milestone in yoga’s spread in the West was Paramahansa Yogananda’s book, Autobiography of a
                Yogi, published in 1946 and still read by many yoga students, Sherwin says. In the first half of the
                20th century, it was more common for yoga instructors to travel from city to city to teach a yoga class
                or give a yoga lecture rather than teach in a studio (as is the case today).right up arrow
                Notably, changes in U.S. immigration policy starting in 1965 allowed more South Asian immigrants to come
                to America (including yogis from India, where the practice was more established).right up arrow By the
                1970s, yoga studios and books could be found across the United States.</p>

            <h2>Does Yoga Count as Exercise?</h2>
            Yoga didn't originate as an exercise program, but some styles have been adapted into workouts focused on the
            physical parts of the practice, says Edward Laskowski, MD, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist
            and the former codirector of Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. “People have different
            goals coming into yoga. Some may do yoga for the contemplative or meditative part of it and some people
            might want more of the exercise and activity part.”

            Anything that elevates our heart rate for a consistent period of time is beneficial to overall fitness, he
            says. “The heart is a muscle, and when you challenge it by elevating your heart rate you make it stronger,”
            says Dr. Laskowski.

            Yoga probably isn’t in the same category of aerobic exercise as running or biking, says Laskowski. But the
            amount of aerobic benefit a person could get from yoga depends a lot on the style and pace of the type of
            yoga you’re doing, he says.

            Yoga can also help build strength, Laskowski says. Certain positions and poses where a person must hold up
            part of their body weight will challenge a muscle and make it stronger, he says.

            It’s a good way to get your resistance training in, because yoga builds functional strength (meaning you get
            stronger by using multiple joint and muscle groups together rather than strengthening a specific muscle in
            isolation, as you might do in weight lifting). “That’s good, because that’s what we do in our daily life,”
            he says.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Health Benefits of Yoga</h2>
            “The benefits of yoga are different for different people,” Laskowski says. “Overall, it has components that
            can help with flexibility, strength, balance, and stability.”

            Research has shown it can also help with specific measures of health, like eating habits, weight loss and
            weight loss maintenance, and cardiovascular health.right up arrow

            A review looking at one year of recent research found that people who practiced yoga saw improvements across
            several measures of health, including: anxiety, stress, body composition, blood pressure, inflammation, and
            metabolic markers in people with type 2 diabetes.right up arrow
            A meta-analysis found that yoga interventions helped middle-aged people with a body mass index (BMI) of 25
            or higher to lower their blood pressure. The benefits were greater when the yoga intervention included
            breathing techniques and meditation.right up arrow
            Another study found that yoga motivated nearly two-thirds of people to exercise more, and 40 percent of
            people to eat healthier.right up arrow
            There is also evidence that yoga may help people with certain health conditions and chronic diseases manage
            pain and other symptoms, and with overall quality of life.</p>

            <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
            Vinyasa yoga is one of the most popular kinds of yoga in the United States, says Jen Fleming, a yoga teacher
            and manager at YogaWorks in Atlanta, who is certified by Yoga Alliance. Although vinyasa can be a set
            sequence of poses that never changes, as in ashtanga vinyasa, flow vinyasa classes will be different every
            time, she says.

            Different styles of vinyasa yoga also include power yoga, Baptiste yoga, Jivamukti, and prana flow. These
            kinds of classes are among the most athletic and physically challenging, says Fleming.

            It can be difficult to keep up with the pace of a vinyasa class if you don’t have yoga experience, adds
            Shala Worsley, a yoga instructor at Asheville Yoga Center in Asheville, North Carolina, who is certified by
            Yoga Alliance. “If you want to try vinyasa yoga and you don’t have much experience, try to find a studio
            that offers a beginner or a slow flow class,” says Worsley.</p>

            <h2>Hot Yoga</h2>
            Hot yoga is yoga practiced in a hotter-than-normal room, and the style of yoga performed can vary from
            studio to studio, says Samantha Scupp, the founder and a teacher at Heatwise, a New York City–based hot yoga
            studio, who is certified by Yoga Alliance.

            <h3> Here are a few things to know before you try it.</h3>

            <h3>How Hot Is a Hot Yoga Class?</h3>
            In hot yoga, the room is heated to temperatures that can range from the high 80s to 105 degrees F, on
            average.right up arrow
            Not only can the temperature fluctuate depending on the studio (check the class description or call the
            individual studio to find out details), but the method of heating can be different as well, says Scupp.

            Along with conventional heating, some studios use a humidifier to make the room feel warmer. Some studios,
            like Heatwise, use infrared heat that comes from electric heat panels that are placed on the ceiling or
            around the room, which can feel more natural than forced-air heat, she says. The size of the room, the
            weather outside, and how packed the class is can all be factors in how hot the room gets, Scupp says.

            Not All Hot Yoga Classes Are the Same
            Yoga done in a hot environment is called “hot yoga.” Hot yoga became popular in the 1970s with a specific
            style called Bikram yoga, and heat is now used to enhance a variety of yoga styles.

            Vinyasa yoga or flow-type yoga practiced in a heated studio can also be called hot yoga. It would be a good
            idea to have some yoga experience before you step into a hot yoga class, says Scupp. Depending on the
            studio, there may be a beginner level course offered.

            Pregnant Women, People With Heart Conditions, and Some Others Should Check With Their MD Before Doing Hot
            Yoga
            In general, hot yoga is safe for someone as long as they’re in good health, says Laskowski. If a person has
            certain preexisting chronic health conditions, previous heat injury, certain heart conditions, easily gets
            dehydrated, or is pregnant, it may not be safe to do hot yoga, he says.

            “It’s always a good idea to check with your doctor if you’re going to try an activity that could stress your
            body,” says Laskowski.

            <h2>What Are Other Popular Styles of Yoga?</h2>
            There are about 20 major types of yoga, and certain kinds can appeal to certain individuals, says Laskowski.
            That’s because people often have different goals and reasons for wanting to do yoga, he says.

            Depending on where you live and the size of the yoga community, you may find several types of yoga offered
            at studios near you. Here are a few of those types.

            <h3> Hatha Yoga </h3>
            Hatha yoga (pronounced HAH-ta, not -tha) encompasses several types of yoga, including ashtanga, vinyasa, and
            power yoga. Hatha classes tend to be slower-paced than vinyasa classes, and may not necessarily flow from
            pose to pose, says Fleming. Poses are typically held for several breaths before another pose begins. What is
            consistent across different types of hatha yoga is that the physical poses and postures are meant to be
            linked to your breathing patterns.

            <h3> Ashtanga Yoga </h3>
            Ashtanga yoga is a physically demanding type of yoga that moves quickly from pose to pose. Unlike flow or
            vinyasa yoga, there are set sequences that are meant to be performed in a specific order. Ashtanga yoga can
            be practiced in a teacher-led class or in a Mysore format. Mysore is self-guided with an instructor present
            but not leading the class. In a Mysore format, students are expected to know the sequence and timing of the
            poses from memory, Fleming explains.

            <h3> Kundalini Yoga </h3>
            Kundalini yoga combines postures, breathing, meditation, and the chanting of mantras. Traditionally,
            kundalini yoga is meant to “awaken” the different energies inside each of us and heighten
            consciousness.right up arrow
            <h3>Yin Yoga </h3>
            Yin yoga is a style in which there’s no flowing from pose to pose. You stay mostly seated on the floor or
            lying on your back or belly, Fleming says.

            It’s more passive and focuses on stretching. And the poses are held longer than in other types of yoga, says
            Fleming. “This kind of stretching can be good for the joints in a different way than active stretching,”
            says Fleming.

            <h3>Yoga Nidra </h3>
            Yoga nidra is more of a meditation than a pose-filled yoga class. Students lie on their backs (a blanket or
            bolster can be used to add comfort) as the teacher guides them through focusing on and relaxing different
            parts of the body. People who practice yoga nidra are encouraged to “let go” and surrender to total
            relaxation and peace. It can be as relaxing and restorative as actual sleep, says Fleming.</p>
