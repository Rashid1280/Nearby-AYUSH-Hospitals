        <p>AYUSH is the acronym of the medical systems that are being practiced in India
            such as Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. These systems
            are based on definite medical philosophies and represent a way of healthy living with
            established conceptson prevention of diseases and promotion of health. The basic approach
            of all these systems on health, disease and treatment are holistic. Because of this, there
            is a resurgence of intereston AYUSH systems. Yoga has now become the icon of global
            health and many countries havestarted integrating it in their health care delivery system.
            Similarly there is great curiosity to understand the principles and practice of Ayurveda,
            Homeopathy, Siddha and Unani especiallydue to growing challenges in medicine in Non
            Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Life style disorders, long term diseases, multi drug
            resistant diseases, emergence of new diseases etc. In 1995, with the objective of optimal
            and focused development of these systems, the Department of Indian Medicine and
            Homeopathy (ISM & H) was created in the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
            In 2003, this Department was re named as Department of AYUSH.

            India has a rich heritage of medical wisdom conserved as traditional healthcare systems.
            These were the principal medical practices of the country for centuries, forming part of
            Indian ethos and culture. Traditional medicine is defined as bringing together of
            knowledge, skill, and practices based on theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to
            different cultures, whether explicable or not, used for therapeutic, restorative, prevention,
            diagnosis and maintenance of physical and mental health . Traditional Medicine continues
            to be widely used in most countries, and its uptake is increasing rapidly in other countries.
            In India, Traditional Medicine is popular as Indian System of Medicine (ISM&H), It is the
            culmination of Indian thought of medicine which represents a way of healthy living valued
            with a long and unique cultural history, as also amalgamating the best of influences that
            came in from contact with other civilizations be it Greece (resulting in Unani Medicine) or
            Germany (Homeopathy) or our scriptures/sages which gave us the science of Ayurveda,
            Siddha and also Yoga & Naturopathy. These systems are based on definite medical
            philosophies and represent a way of healthy living with established concepts on prevention
            of disease and promotion of health. The basic approach of all these systems on health,
            disease and treatment are holistic. Because of this, there is a resurgence of interest on
            AYUSH systems.
